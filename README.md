##  SQL Queries


1. **Total Premium Collected**:
```sql
Select sum(Premium) AS Total_premium
from sales;

```


2. **Total Commission Earned**:
```sql
Select SUM(commission_amount) AS Total_Commission
from sales;
```

2. **Average Commission %**:
```sql
Select AVG(`Commission_%`) AS Average_Commission
from sales;
```

4. **Number of Policies Sold**:
```sql
Select count(*) AS Total_Policies
from sales;
```

 5. **Total Net Profit**
```sql
Select sum(net_profit) AS Total_profit
from sales;
```

6. **Region-Wise Performance**
```sql
SELECT Region, SUM(Premium) AS Total_Premium, SUM(Net_Profit) AS Total_Profit
FROM sales
GROUP BY Region;
```

7. **Top Performing Salesperson**
```sql
Select salesperson, sum(net_profit) AS Total_profit
from sales
group by salesperson
order by total_profit DESC
limit 1;
```

8. **Insurer-Wise Profitability**
```sql
Select insurer, sum(net_profit) AS Total_profit
from sales
group by insurer
order by total_profit DESC;
```

9.**Monthly Sales Trend**
```sql
SELECT DATE_FORMAT(Date, '%Y-%m') AS Month, SUM(Premium) AS Total_Premium
FROM sales
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;
```

10.**Insurer Profitability Index**:
```sql
SELECT Insurer,
  AVG(Net_Profit) AS Avg_Profit,
  AVG(`Claim_Ratio_%`) AS Avg_Claim_Ratio,
  AVG(Float_Days) AS Avg_Float_Time,
  AVG(`Commission_%`) AS Avg_Comm,
  (AVG(Net_Profit) / (AVG(`Claim_Ratio_%`) + 1)) AS Profitability_Index
FROM sales
GROUP BY Insurer
ORDER BY Profitability_Index DESC;
```

11.**Policy Mix Ratio**
```sql
SELECT
  Policy_Type,
  COUNT(*) * 100.0 / (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales) AS Policy_Mix_Percentage
FROM sales
GROUP BY Policy_Type
order by policy_mix_percentage desc;
```

12.**Insurer Dependency Risk**
```sql
SELECT
  Insurer,
  SUM(Net_Profit) AS Profit,
  ROUND(100.0 * SUM(Net_Profit) / (SELECT SUM(Net_Profit) FROM sales), 2) AS Profit_Contribution_Percent
FROM sales
GROUP BY Insurer
ORDER BY Profit DESC;
```
